**baseproject** is an effort to provide a basis from which one can quickly
create new web projects. It's how I like to have things set up anyway.

## Technologies used
* grunt for build management
* bower for package management
* npm/node for grunt plugins and dependencies

## Grunt Tasks
* `grunt build`
* `grunt clean`
* `grunt serve`
* `grunt test`
